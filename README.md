This is the successor to TFS Aggregator.
The current Server Plugin version (2.x) will be maintained to support TFS.
The Web Service flavor will be discontinued in favor of this (its deployment and configuration was too complex for most users).

The main scenario for Aggregator (3.x) is supporting Azure DevOps and the cloud scenario. It will work for TFS as long as it is reachable from Internet.

> **This is an early version (beta)**: we might change verbs and rule language before the final release!
*Note*: The documentation is limited to this page and the content of the `doc` folder.

## Major features

- use of new Azure DevOps REST API
- simple deployment via CLI tool
- Rule object model similar to v2

## Planned features

- Support for Deployment Slots for blue/green-style deployments
- OAuth support to avoid maintain access tokens
- Additional Azure DevOps events
- Additional Azure DevOps objects

## How it works

An Aggregator Instance is an Azure Function Application in its own Resource Group,
sharing the same Azure DevOps credential. You can have only one Application per Resource Group.
If the Resource Group does not exists, Aggregator will try to create it.
*Note*: The Instance name must be **unique** amongst all Aggregator Instances in Azure!

Each Aggregator Rule becomes an Azure Function in the above instance.
The Rule code is parsed and run on-the-spot using Roslyn.
To work, it uses an Aggregator Runtime.
Aggregator checks its latest GitHub Release to ensure that Aggregator Runtime is up-to-date before uploading the function.
*Note*: We use [Azure Functions Runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions) 2.0 for C# which is still in Preview.

An Aggregator Mapping is a Azure DevOps Service Hook for a specific work item event that invokes an Aggregator Rule i.e. the Azure Function hosting the Rule code. Azure DevOps saves the Azure Function Key in the Service Hook configuration.

You can deploy the same Rule in many Instances or map the same Azure DevOps event to many Rules: it is up to you choosing the best way to organize.

## Authentication

You must instruct Aggregator which credential to use.
To do this, run the `login.azure` and `login.ado` commands.

To create the credentials, you need an Azure Service Principal and a Azure DevOps Personal Access Token.

These documents will guide you in creating the credentials
* [Use portal to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal)        
* [Create personal access tokens to authenticate access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate).

Logon credentials are stored locally and expire after 2 hours.

The PAT is also stored in the Azure Function settings: **whoever has access to the Resource Group can read it!**

The Service Principal must have Contributor permission to the Azure Subscription or, in alternative, pre-create the Resource Group in Azure and give the service account Contributor permission to the Resource Group.

If you go this route, remember add the `--resourceGroup` to all commands requiring an instance, otherwise the `instance` parameter adds an `aggregator-` prefixe to find the Resource Group.

## Usage

Download and unzip the latest CLI.zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/tfsaggregator/aggregator-cli/releases).
It requires [.Net Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).
To run Aggregator use
`dotnet aggregator-cli.dll` followed by the verb and the options.

## Troubleshooting

### View live Aggregator log messages

In Azure Portal, open the Resource Group hosting the Instance (`aggregator-` followed by name of instance).
Open the App Service hosting the Instance (instance name followed by `aggregator`).
Switch to the **Platform features** tab and click on _Log streaming_ like in the picture.
